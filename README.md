# Local minima and multistate capture-recapture models

This repository contains R code to illustrate solutions to avoid local minima in multistate capture-recapture models. This work is largely inspired by Chapter 9 of the [Gentle Introduction to Mark](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/) by E. Cooch & G. White.

In details, you will find:
* multistate_local_minimav2.pdf: a few slides to present the issue
* multistate_local_minima.R: illustration with simulated data
* locmin_cr.Rmd, locmin_cr.docx, locmin_cr.html: illustration with real data
