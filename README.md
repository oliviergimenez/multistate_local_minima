# Local minima and multistate capture-recapture models

This repository contains R code to illustrate solutions to avoid local minima in multistate capture-recapture models. 
There are also a few slides to present the issue. This work is largely inspired by Chapter 9 of 
the [Gentle Introduction to Mark](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/) by E. Cooch & G. White.
