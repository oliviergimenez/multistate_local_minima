## Model

We consider a state-space formulation of multistate capture-recapture model. We refer to [Gimenez et al. (2007). State-space modelling of data on marked individuals. Ecological Modelling 206: 431-438](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/Servantyetal2010Ecology.pdf) and [Servanty et al. (2010). Assessing whether mortality is additive using marked animals: a Bayesian state-space modeling approach. Ecology 91: 1916â€“1923](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/Gimenezetal2007EcologicalModelling.pdf) for the theory.

## Read in data

I use female roe deer data monitored over 20 years and provided by J.-M. Gaillard. 
Population in Trois Fontaine managed by ONCFS. Two states, with and without fawn.

## Frequentist Analysis with `Mark`

Let's format the data to be analysed.
```{r}
his = his[,-ncol(his)] # remove last column, these are the counts
k = ncol(his) # nb of capture occasions	
n = nrow(his) # nb of individuals	
out = array(dim=n)	
for (i in 1:n){	
	y = (his[i,] > 0) * his[i,]	
	out[i] = paste(y,collapse="")	
}	
capt.hist = data.frame(ch = out)	
```

Load RMark package	
```{r}
library(RMark)	
```

	
Process data and create default design matrix
```{r}
mstrata.processed=process.data(capt.hist,model="Multistrata")	
mstrata.ddl=make.design.data(mstrata.processed)	
```

Define structure on parameters, all state dependent	
```{r}
# survival probability	
S.site = list(formula=~stratum) 	
# detection probability	
p.site = list(formula=~stratum) 	
# transition probs	
Psi.site = list(formula=~-1+stratum:tostratum)	
```

Fit model
```{r}
mstrata.mod = mark(mstrata.processed,mstrata.ddl,model.parameters=list(S=S.site,p= p.site,Psi=Psi.site),output=FALSE,silent=T,delete=T)	
```

Let's have a look to the parameter estimates
```{r}
mstrata.mod$results$real[c(1:5,195),]
```

Now let's re-run the same model but changing the initial values
```{r}
nb_inits = 5 # five runs with diff inits
set.seed(3) # to reproduce the results
res_dev = rep(NA,nb_inits)
res = list()
for (i in 1:nb_inits){
	inits = rnorm(6,0,1)
	mstrata.sim = mark(mstrata.processed,mstrata.ddl,model.parameters=
	list(S=S.site,p= p.site,Psi=Psi.site),output=FALSE,silent=TRUE,delete=T,initial = inits)
	res_dev[i] = mstrata.sim$results$deviance
	res[[i]] = mstrata.sim$results
}
```

Display the deviance values
```{r}
res_dev
```

There seems to be a local minimum. Let's have a look to the estimates corresponding to the global minimum
```{r}
res[[2]]$real[c(1:5,195),1:4]
```

What about the estimates with a local minimum?
```{r}
res[[1]]$real[c(1:5,195),1:4]
```

## Graphical examination

We use a graph of profile deviance to examine local minima. Let's do it for survival first:
```{r}
fr = mstrata.ddl$S$stratum
ii = (fr==1)
phi.fix = as.numeric(row.names(mstrata.ddl$S[ii,]))

grid = seq(.6,0.8,0.01/2)
#length(grid)
dev = rep(NA,length(grid))
ind = 1
for (i in grid){
	S.fix = list(formula=~stratum,fixed=list(index=phi.fix,value=i)) # survival depends on states		
	res.fix = mark(mstrata.processed,mstrata.ddl,model.parameters=list(S=S.fix,p=p.site,Psi=Psi.site),output = FALSE,delete=T,silent=T)
	dev[ind] = res.fix$results$deviance
	ind = ind + 1
}
dev_phi = dev
grid_phi = grid
```

Then for a transition
```{r}
fr = mstrata.ddl$Psi$stratum
to = mstrata.ddl$Psi$tostratum
ii = (fr==2 & to==1)
psi.fix = as.numeric(row.names(mstrata.ddl$Psi[ii,])) # careful not to define Psi.fix twice

grid = seq(.05,0.55,0.01)
#length(grid)
dev = rep(NA,length(grid))
ind = 1
for (i in grid){
	Psi.fix = list(formula=~-1+stratum:tostratum,fixed=list(index=psi.fix,value=i),link='logit')	 # needs logit here, mlogit is a mess
	res.fix = mark(mstrata.processed,mstrata.ddl,model.parameters=list(S=S.site,p=p.site,Psi=Psi.fix),output = FALSE,delete=T,silent=T)
	dev[ind] = res.fix$results$deviance
	ind = ind + 1
}
dev_psi = dev
grid_psi = grid
```

Let's visualize the results
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(grid_phi,dev_phi,type='l',xlab=expression(phiA),ylab='deviance',col='black',lwd=3)
plot(grid_psi,dev_psi,type='l',xlab=expression(psiBA),ylab='deviance',col='black',lwd=3)
```

## Bayesian analysis with `Jags`

Let us get the occasion of first capture for each individual:
```{r}
get.first <- function(x) min(which(x!=0))
f <- apply(his, 1, get.first)
```

Recode the data such that 1 is seen alive in A (with fawn), 2 is seen alive in B (without fawn), 3 = not seen:
```{r}
his_recoded <- his
his_recoded[his_recoded==0] <- 3
```

Then we fit a multistate model:
```{r}
{
sink("state_on_survival.jags")
cat("
model {

      po[1,i,t,2] <- 0
      po[1,i,t,3] <- 1-pA

      # State process: draw S(t) given S(t-1)
      z[i,t] ~ dcat(ps[z[i,t-1], i, t-1,])
      # Observation process: draw O(t) given S(t)
      y[i,t] ~ dcat(po[z[i,t], i, t-1,])
